# RT-CONNECT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

## Current checkpoint

- **Goal:** Hoàn thiện RT-CONNECT theo `plan.md` từ P0 đến P19 và thiết lập baseline vận hành P20.
- **Current phase:** P8 — PSQA Gamma queue, deterministic engine contract and result artifacts; P7 Machine QA is complete on staging.
- **Current status:** IN_PROGRESS — P8 has passed the authenticated 2D synthetic staging E2E flow through the deployed Redis Streams worker, including worker completion, result snapshot, compare and refresh persistence. The full P8 exit gate remains open for the authenticated queue-metrics endpoint, failure/retry evidence and broader RTDOSE/3D/large-input coverage.
- **Last authoritative check:** 2026-09-08 — backend full suite `45/45`, strict mypy/Ruff and frontend typecheck/lint/test/build passed. Worker deployment `fb446c0e-2a1b-4a17-88f3-aeb8b5318e3c` from commit `5ec12fb` reported successful and logged `queue_backend=redis_stream`, stream `rt-connect:gamma`, group `rt-connect-gamma`. Staging Gamma run `e084529d-6bb1-4119-ae0a-f4da7d371cac` completed `PASS` on `gamma-2d-p8.1` with 100% (4/4); Redis reported stream length `2`, consumer-group `pending=0`, `lag=0`, `entries-read=2` and two consumers.
- **Next exact step:** exercise the deployed `FAILED → retry → COMPLETED` path, then decide and document the RTDOSE/3D scope gate before starting P9.

## Phase status

| Phase | Status | Evidence / next gate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | DONE | Exit audit passed on 2026-09-05; baseline, traceability, module/route/environment registries and Railway failure issue recorded |
| P1 | DONE | Full local Compose build/health, in-container PostgreSQL migration, synthetic seed persistence, API readiness and web health passed on 2026-09-05 |
| P2 | FOUNDATION READY + LIVE SMOKE PASS | JWT contract, PostgreSQL, Railway staging/production deployment foundation, Supabase Auth configuration and public health/readiness smoke are evidenced; production promotion remains gated by later clinical modules |
| P3 | STAGING E2E PASS | Auth/API bootstrap, organization-scoped dashboard, first-use organization onboarding and protected web routes are deployed; authenticated staging session reached the real organization dashboard |
| P4 | STAGING E2E PASS | Organization/site/machine lifecycle is deployed; staging smoke created and displayed `Hong ngoc general hospital`, `Staging Synthetic Site` and `Synthetic QA Linac` |
| P5 | STAGING E2E PASS | Nested folder/QA case flow is deployed; staging smoke created `Staging P6 Smoke` and QA case `8bc86303-c7e9-4e1a-b012-cfbe2a07ba24` |
| P6 | STAGING E2E PASS | Migration `20260907_0005`, artifact metadata/checksum, Input Manifest, duplicate upload, Railway S3-compatible storage, DICOM/measurement validator and QA Archive upload panel are deployed; authenticated synthetic upload created the manifest, validation returned `VALID` with 0 errors/0 warnings and the signed Download action was invoked |
| P7 | STAGING E2E PASS | Migration `20260907_0006`; protocol/rule seed, scoped Machine QA run lifecycle, draft revision, evaluation, immutable result/rerun/compare and trend projection are implemented; staging evaluate returned PASS for `output_factor=100`, `symmetry=1`, `flatness=100`, then rerun and compare preserved both histories |
| P8 | STAGING REDIS STREAM E2E PASS; FULL EXIT GATE OPEN | Migration `20260907_0007`; organization/case-scoped preflight, idempotent Gamma job snapshot, deterministic 2D engine, Redis-capable worker entrypoint with DB fallback, result map/metrics/warnings, logical-role-aware artifact contract and Gamma Workspace are implemented; staging worker completed validated JSON runs with PASS, compare and refresh persistence; the live Redis consumer group acknowledged the deployed run with zero pending messages. Authenticated queue-metrics endpoint smoke, failure/retry evidence and any retained RTDOSE/3D gate remain |

`get_project` still exposes the four old Biological instances as `hidden`. They are deprecated and must not be restored or used as design-to-code sources. P12–P15 will create new screens one at a time in the same project.

## Live Railway evidence — verified 2026-09-06

- Project: `prolific-learning` (`339f2c50-ddd7-491f-8c4e-da2a2d169502`).
- Production: environment `910dff25-75b6-42b2-bf6b-e2601ba9d7d2`, API `RT-connect`, PostgreSQL `Postgres`.
- Staging: environment `b0ab34e5-0ff4-479d-8232-659d175e9e2f`, API `gleaming-cooperation`, PostgreSQL `Postgres-Q1Hc`.
- API region in both environments: `us-west2`; the obsolete `sfo` alias was removed from API service configuration after blocking a production deployment.
- Production deployment `ec813793-4e29-4edb-b5d7-f323264da403`: `SUCCESS`, commit `c52b61412c1e1e65b7fca53d7e4d600f85a2dd7e`.
- Staging deployment `2b5270d1-9704-49b3-b3d8-0f8be130d02e`: `SUCCESS`, commit `9bf96e92f6853d5650312c5fcd82ff67a7f85c1b`.
- Both API services use `/apps/api`, `/apps/api/Dockerfile`, `PORT=8000`, `/api/v1/health` and `alembic upgrade head`.
- Public smoke: production and staging both returned HTTP 200 with `status=ok` from `/api/v1/health` and `status=ready` from `/api/v1/ready`; correlation IDs were present.
- PostgreSQL services retain their current persistent-volume region configuration; no database region migration was performed without backup/restore evidence.

## Live Railway storage evidence — verified 2026-09-07

- A persistent Railway S3-compatible storage bucket was deployed in the staging environment for P6 artifact objects; it is not the API container filesystem.
- The bucket was provisioned in Railway's default US West region and exposes an S3-compatible endpoint with automatic region handling. The six staging API variables required by `MinioObjectStorage` were configured without printing their secret values, and the API service was redeployed afterward.
- A direct non-PHI storage probe passed for both path-style and virtual-host-style addressing: put, get, presigned URL generation and delete all succeeded. The bucket remained empty after the probe.
- Staging API health and readiness remained HTTP 200 after the storage-variable redeploy. The remaining evidence is the authenticated web upload → validation → signed download smoke test using the repository fixture.

## Live Railway P8 queue evidence — verified 2026-09-08

- Staging Redis service `Redis` (`ca18f134-82fb-44a1-ac5c-cde76fb33882`) is online and connected to both the API and private `RT-connect-gamma-worker-staging` service.
- Worker deployment `fb446c0e-2a1b-4a17-88f3-aeb8b5318e3c` from commit `5ec12fb` is active and successful. Its deployment log records `Gamma worker starting queue_backend=redis_stream stream=rt-connect:gamma group=rt-connect-gamma` followed by `Gamma worker using Redis Streams queue`.
- After the worker restart, the authenticated Gamma Workspace submitted run `e084529d-6bb1-4119-ae0a-f4da7d371cac`; the run reached `COMPLETED`, `PASS`, 100% (4/4 evaluated and passing points), target 95%, excluded 0 and Gamma P95 `0.0708333333333318`.
- Redis console evidence for the same staging queue: `XLEN rt-connect:gamma = 2`; consumer group `rt-connect-gamma` has 2 consumers, `pending = 0`, `entries-read = 2` and `lag = 0`. This proves publish → claim → analysis completion → acknowledge for the current 2D synthetic scope. It does not by itself close the authenticated queue-metrics API, failure/retry or RTDOSE/3D commissioning gates.
- The deployed web Status page called the authenticated `/api/v1/gamma/queue-metrics` endpoint successfully and displayed `redis_stream · available · configured`, stream `2`, pending `0`, consumers `3`, and organization run counts queued/running/retrying/failed all `0`.

## Historical Railway evidence (superseded)

> Snapshot superseded on 2026-09-06: staging and production now have separate API/PostgreSQL services, both deployments succeeded with `PORT=8000`, healthcheck `/api/v1/health`, pre-deploy `alembic upgrade head`, and public `/api/v1/health` plus `/api/v1/ready` returned HTTP 200. The older lines below are retained as historical P0/P2 evidence.

> Current deployment IDs: staging `bfc15784-6b59-418d-bba4-134f4a8154af` on `2754013`; production `85d1ba15-f45c-4958-8ebd-fcf09cbf75ef` on `a721cff` (runtime code from `5a5069f`).

- Project: `prolific-learning` (`339f2c50-ddd7-491f-8c4e-da2a2d169502`).
- Workspace: `Mạc Đăng Quang's Projects` (`53fb850d-a59c-4690-816f-01aea06f0645`).
- Only environment: `production` (`910dff25-75b6-42b2-bf6b-e2601ba9d7d2`).
- Only service: `RT-connect` (`9544c3e6-c8bd-4c29-b62e-c6172eb51af3`).
- Latest deployment: `FAILED`, deployment `b8037f6c-720c-407c-b5e4-34421358b4a3`, stopped.
- No service/custom domain and no Railway bucket were present in the status payload.
- Account and project token scopes were verified without printing token values.
- Railway CLI was not installed globally; `npx @railway/cli` version `5.49.1` was used read-only.
- Workspace usage query returned `UNAUTHORIZED`; exact billing/usage remains unavailable with the supplied token scope and must not be guessed.

Failed deployment root cause from build log: Railpack could not determine a build because the deployed commit contained only documents/static files and no `start.sh`, Dockerfile, Python/Node application manifest or supported runnable source. No redeploy was attempted.

## Repository evidence

- Repository contained only the four canonical Markdown files before P0 artifact creation.
- `.env` is Git-ignored and untracked.
- Secret values were not read into output; only key names were inventoried.
- User-owned deletions are preserved: `UI-UX.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `Biological-toolkit.html`.
- User-owned rename is preserved: `technical.md` → `technical-specification.md`.
- No reset, checkout or restoration of deleted files was performed.

## P0 deliverables

| Deliverable | Location | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Baseline snapshot | `docs/p0-baseline.md` | Verified |
| Traceability matrix | `docs/traceability-matrix.md` | Verified |
| Module registry | `docs/module-registry.md` | Verified |
| Route registry | `docs/route-registry.md` | Verified |
| Environment/secret inventory | `docs/environment-inventory.md` | Verified |
| Railway failed-deployment issue | `docs/issues/railway-failed-deployment.md` | Verified |

## Tests and checks

- P0 live Stitch project/screen/design-system check: PASS.
- Railway account-token project query: PASS.
- Railway project-token scope query: PASS.
- Railway status query: PASS.
- Railway failed deployment log retrieval: PASS.
- Railway workspace usage query: UNAVAILABLE (`UNAUTHORIZED`), recorded without guessing cost.
- Documentation consistency scan: PASS — source hashes equal recorded baseline; legacy hidden Biological IDs have no active mapping; all 17 modules occur in registry and traceability matrix.
- Secret scan: PASS — no `.env` value was found in tracked Markdown; inventory contains variable names only.
- Git diff check: PASS — only CRLF conversion notices were emitted; no whitespace error was reported.
- P0 exit audit: PASS — canonical technical filename, no UI-UX dependency, all four active application screens have owners, all other module screen gaps are explicit, Stitch/Railway IDs are recorded.
- P1 API pytest: PASS — 7 tests; FastAPI health/version/error/correlation contracts verified.
- P1 API quality: PASS — Ruff and strict mypy on 15 source files.
- P1 migration contract: PASS — Alembic revision `20260905_0001` renders PostgreSQL DDL successfully; up/down functions are present.
- P1 OpenAPI: PASS — generated contract at `docs/openapi.json` verifies reproducibly.
- P1 API process smoke: PASS — temporary local Uvicorn process returned `health=ok`, a correlation ID and version metadata; process was stopped and port released.
- P1 web quality: PASS — lint, TypeScript type check, 1 component test and production Vite build.
- P1 web E2E: PASS — 1 Playwright Chromium test against production preview build.
- P1 dependency checks: PASS — Python `pip check`; production Node `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` found no vulnerability.
- P1 source secret scan: PASS — no value from local `.env` appeared outside ignored environment files.
- P1 Compose verification: PASS — Docker Desktop Linux engine built the complete stack; all five services healthy; clean PostgreSQL migration, synthetic seed persistence, API readiness and web health passed. The scoped test stack and volumes were removed by the verifier.
- P2 JWT security contract: PASS — 17 API tests cover missing Bearer, missing configuration, valid asymmetric token, expiry, issuer, audience, role, signature and JWKS-client failure; Ruff and strict mypy pass. This is local cryptographic evidence, not a live Supabase sign-in result.
- P2 deployment preparation: PASS — `apps/api/railway.toml` now applies the baseline migration before deploy; staging Railway/Supabase variable contracts and runbooks are in `deployment/`.
- P2 Railway deployment foundation: PASS — effective settings were applied directly in staging and production; both deployments use `PORT=8000`, `/api/v1/health`, `alembic upgrade head`, and both public `/health` plus `/ready` smoke checks returned HTTP 200.
- P2 Railway permission audit: account token can read production status but `railway link`/environment mutation is rejected with `UNAUTHORIZED`; usage query is also unauthorized. No Railway resource was created or changed.
- The permission-audit snapshot above is historical; the current Railway service settings were successfully changed through the dashboard and are recorded in the superseding live evidence note above.
- P2 Railway source audit: the old failed deployment analyzed `aa5dce6`, but `origin/main` now points to `dc6ee79` and contains the API/web source. The deployment for `dc6ee79` was skipped because the GitHub secret-guard job failed; API and web jobs passed. The CI guard has been corrected to allow `.env.example` templates while rejecting private environment files and credentials.
- P2 post-change local regression: PASS — full `scripts/verify-p1.ps1 -WithContainers` completed after JWT, CORS and Railway manifest changes: 17 API tests, lint/type checks, migration SQL, web checks, five healthy Compose services, in-container migration, synthetic seed persistence, API readiness and web health. The scoped stack and test volumes were removed.
- P2 Stitch recheck: PASS — project `RT-connect` remains public with the Clinical Precision Interface design system, the four active QA application screens, and four hidden/deprecated Biological screen instances. No Stitch design was altered during P2.
- P3 design: Login screen `3b857ee77e7a434d8cfdcda32fd62cdb` generated in the active RT-connect Stitch project using the Clinical Precision Interface design system; no patient data or secret was sent to Stitch.
- P3 local implementation: PASS — `UserIdentity`/`OrganizationMembership`, session bootstrap and organization-scoped dashboard endpoints; migration `20260906_0002`; backend lint, strict mypy and 20 tests pass. Frontend Supabase session/auth routes, protected dashboard and API-backed empty/populated/error states lint/type-check/test/build successfully.
- P4 local implementation: PASS — migration `20260906_0003` adds organization/site/machine lifecycle fields and append-only audit events; all CRUD/list/archive mutations resolve organization scope from the verified identity before resource lookup. Rename preserves `stable_machine_id`; duplicate IDs and second ambiguous organization contexts return explicit conflicts. Backend Ruff, strict mypy and 26 tests pass; frontend organization management page, API client, lint, TypeScript check, Vitest and Vite build pass. No live Auth or staging P4 workflow has been claimed.
- P5 local implementation: PASS — migration `20260906_0004` adds nested organization folders and QA cases; folder rename/move/archive preserves QA case identity, archive does not hard-delete history, case references require an active site/machine/folder in the same organization, and searches support text, folder and QA-cycle filtering. Backend Ruff, strict mypy and 29 tests pass; frontend QA Archive route/API client, lint, TypeScript check, Vitest and Vite build pass. No live Auth or staging P5 workflow has been claimed.
- P6 local implementation: PASS — migration `20260907_0005` adds `artifacts`, `input_manifests` and `validation_runs`; MinIO/S3 storage port, byte-for-byte SHA-256 upload, duplicate detection, signed-download contract, metadata-first DICOM validation and `gamma.measurement.v1` validation are implemented. Focused artifact tests, full API regression, strict mypy, Ruff and frontend checks pass.
- P6 staging evidence: PARTIAL PASS — commit `5b6bf78` deployed successfully to `Railway-API-staging`; the live API exposes the artifact/upload/validation paths; the web staging bundle contains P6 upload UI; the authenticated dashboard, organization, site, machine, folder and QA case are reachable; the persistent Railway bucket is deployed and S3 operations pass. Live artifact upload/validation/download is pending the synthetic fixture selection in the browser.
- P6 authenticated staging evidence: PASS — the user-selected `docs/fixtures/gamma-measurement-v1-smoke.json` appeared as `gamma-measurement-v1-smoke.json` (572 bytes) in QA Archive; upload created the Input Manifest, validation displayed `VALID: 0 lỗi, 0 cảnh báo`, the artifact status changed to `VALID`, and the UI invoked its signed Download action.
- P7 local implementation: PASS — migration `20260907_0006` adds organization-scoped protocol versions/rules, `machine_qa_runs` and `trend_points`; the rule engine covers range/min/max/absolute or percent deviation and N/A, records missing/unit errors, snapshots protocol rules, prevents edits after evaluation, and projects numeric metrics to trend points. Focused P7 tests (3), full API regression (36), strict mypy, Ruff, OpenAPI regeneration/check, frontend lint/typecheck/test/build all pass.
- P7 staging evidence: PASS — deployments `483f1a30-af73-46ea-be9f-a70627802a3a` (API) and `b16a2e5c-f2ea-414e-9c92-d85bf1aea57c` (web) reported successful; authenticated Machine QA seeded `MACHINE_QA_BASELINE` v1, created run `9b18fa2f-7a02-4154-853a-270e890fcabe`, evaluated `100 / 1 / 100` as `PASS`, created rerun `5ac1a1c1-a985-4a40-97e4-0c8a8b6864c0`, evaluated it as `PASS`, and the compare table returned all three metric snapshots.
- P8 local implementation: PASS — migration `20260907_0007` adds `gamma_analysis_runs`; preflight requires two organization/case-scoped measurement/JSON artifacts with `VALID` Input Manifests; idempotency keys return the existing run; configuration, checksums and engine version are snapshotted; the deterministic 2D engine supports global/local, absolute/relative, threshold, DTA and grid/bilinear sampling for `gamma.measurement.v1`; result snapshots include map, histogram, pass rate, percentiles and warnings; the separate worker entrypoint persists heartbeat/progress/failure/retry state. Redis Streams enqueue/claim/ack/reclaim and queue-metrics contracts are now implemented with a DB polling fallback when `REDIS_URL` is absent. Gamma/API/worker/Redis tests plus full API suite (45), mypy and Ruff pass; frontend Gamma route typecheck/lint/test/build pass.
- P8 staging infrastructure evidence: PASS — commit `310ec13` is deployed successfully to staging API (`d4991d54-2239-4c7d-a7bf-194c01cc4d66`) and web (`eff1f6ca-d9f1-4dec-aecd-955083ecd7ba`); a private `RT-connect-gamma-worker-staging` service (`a1e0c389-e527-4d4c-995e-2a48f4795dda`) uses `/apps/api`, `python -m rt_connect_api.worker`, no public domain and no HTTP healthcheck, with deployment `4c45c69a-457d-4e8f-b1d9-3deb8d48409b` reported `SUCCESS`. This proves infrastructure deployment only, not Gamma job completion.
- P8 authenticated staging golden smoke: PASS for the current 2D synthetic scope — after API deployment `e3d5a46b-7e8f-47fb-a65d-0c4e477c8f61` from commit `1ad0fc3`, `gamma-reference-v1-smoke.json` and `gamma-evaluation-v1-smoke.json` were uploaded as `JSON`, both validated `VALID` with 0 errors/0 warnings, and the private worker completed runs `9c607a9d-0698-4fc4-bf3f-0b50c3bc474f` and `dd82bdbd-c5af-4929-85fd-c4bea595cadd` with `COMPLETED`, `PASS`, `100%` (4/4 points), target `95%`, excluded `0`, and Gamma P95 `0.0708333333333318`. The second run was compared against the first; a full browser refresh restored both completed histories and the result snapshot.
- P8 corrective implementation: commit `1ad0fc3` makes artifact deduplication type-aware, preserves a manifest for a new logical role and makes readiness use the current app settings; commit `50c7917` adds `logical_roles` to artifact responses so Gamma can select Reference/Evaluation consistently after refresh. Backend `42/42`, Ruff, mypy and frontend typecheck/lint/test/build pass locally. The post-deploy browser smoke passed: after a full reload, Reference selected `gamma-reference-v1-smoke.json` and Evaluation selected `gamma-evaluation-v1-smoke.json`.
- P8 queue implementation: commit `4d09e64` adds `redis==6.4.0`, Redis Streams transport (`XREADGROUP`/`XAUTOCLAIM`/`XACK`), API dispatch and retry integration, authenticated `/api/v1/gamma/queue-metrics`, worker Redis mode and focused fake-client tests. Commit `5ec12fb` adds a non-secret worker startup log for the selected backend. Railway staging has a private `Redis` service and the API/worker service variables contain the private `REDIS_URL` reference; the deployed worker and live Redis-consumer smoke are now evidenced above.

## Current blockers and required gates

The older Railway-history bullets below are retained as evidence of earlier incidents. The current gates are:

- The authenticated staging user and organization onboarding path are working. A fresh browser test should still be repeated after session expiry before treating the auth path as operationally stable.
- P8 current remaining gates: the 2D synthetic worker flow, Redis Streams claim/ack, queue-metrics API, result snapshot, compare and browser refresh persistence are evidenced. An explicit failed-job/retry staging evidence path and any RTDOSE/3D/large-input scope retained in `plan.md` are still open; P8 is not complete until those gates are either implemented and verified or the plan scope is explicitly revised.
- The P7 branch has not been promoted to production. Production promotion remains blocked until Gamma/report/trend/protocol gates, backup and rollback evidence exist.

- Correction on 2026-09-05: both Railway tokens are present in root `.env` and authenticate successfully through the Railway API. Account-token access resolves project `prolific-learning`; project-token scope resolves its production environment. The earlier missing-token report was incorrect. Standard dotenv parsing supports spaces around `=` and quoted values.
- Supabase URL and publishable key are present as names but have empty values. This is the remaining Auth configuration dependency.
- Current Supabase project `RT-connect` is the production `main` branch. Preview branching requires a paid Supabase Pro upgrade, so it is not a suitable free staging isolation mechanism. Do not silently use that production Auth project as the formal staging identity plane; create a separate staging project or explicitly accept a documented temporary shared-auth exception.
- Actual credentials were found in `.env.example` and replaced with empty placeholders; the user's `.env` was preserved.
- Railway account token lacks the write scope needed to create/link staging and the usage scope needed to view costs. A project-write credential is required before any billable Railway resource can be provisioned.
- The current Railway production service has not deployed `dc6ee79`; it still reports the old failed deployment and the new deployment as skipped. After the CI fix is pushed and green, verify Railway sees `dc6ee79` before any staging/production deployment decision.
- The live Railway service metadata still reports `rootDirectory=null` and `dockerfilePath=null`. Configure `/apps/api` on a staging service/environment before testing the Railway Dockerfile; do not use the current production service as the P2 test target.

## Known limitations

- Production has not yet received the P6 artifact branch; promotion remains intentionally gated by the staging artifact E2E and later clinical-module gates.
- The current browser automation cannot inject a local file into the file chooser; the final P6 web smoke therefore requires a manual selection of the repository's synthetic fixture or an equivalent user-driven browser action.
- Four Biological designs must be regenerated in P12–P15.

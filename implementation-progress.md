# RT-CONNECT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

## Current checkpoint

- **Goal:** Hoàn thiện RT-CONNECT theo `plan.md` từ P0 đến P19 và thiết lập baseline vận hành P20.
- **Current phase:** P2 — Railway staging, PostgreSQL và deployment foundation.
- **Current status:** IN_PROGRESS — P1 local gate closed; Railway staging and production deployment foundations are live and externally verified. Supabase Auth/application smoke remains pending.
- **Last authoritative check:** 2026-09-06T02:45:33+07:00.
- **Next exact step:** complete the remaining P2 Auth/API integration gate, then start the first functional vertical slice from the phase plan.

## Live Google Stitch evidence

- Project: `RT-connect`.
- Project ID: `14242591911141046021`.
- Visibility: `PUBLIC`.
- Device baseline: `DESKTOP`.
- Design System: `Clinical Precision Interface`, asset `105b9f4e25334bbcbc6c94d588ee29f9`.
- `list_screens` returned six active resources: four application screens plus logo and avatar.

| Active application screen | Screen ID | Module |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Trang chủ - Home Dashboard | `70b9f1d256884221ae20e63b5244db11` | MOD-01 |
| Kho lưu trữ QA & Thư mục | `4c9ec57310fd404cbae3b53b0bab2368` | MOD-03 |
| Phân tích PSQA Gamma Workspace | `ffb87901b3194bd3aff8760c54c2f9f4` | MOD-04/MOD-06 |
| Trình biên soạn Báo cáo - Report Builder Studio | `a1478466ace843c5aaf9a15dfc58273e` | MOD-07 |

`get_project` still exposes the four old Biological instances as `hidden`. They are deprecated and must not be restored or used as design-to-code sources. P12–P15 will create new screens one at a time in the same project.

## Live Railway evidence

> Snapshot superseded on 2026-09-06: staging and production now have separate API/PostgreSQL services, both deployments succeeded with `PORT=8000`, healthcheck `/api/v1/health`, pre-deploy `alembic upgrade head`, and public `/api/v1/health` plus `/api/v1/ready` returned HTTP 200. The older lines below are retained as historical P0/P2 evidence.

> Current deployment IDs: staging `bfc15784-6b59-418d-bba4-134f4a8154af` on `2754013`; production `85d1ba15-f45c-4958-8ebd-fcf09cbf75ef` on `a721cff` (runtime code from `5a5069f`).

- Project: `prolific-learning` (`339f2c50-ddd7-491f-8c4e-da2a2d169502`).
- Workspace: `Mạc Đăng Quang's Projects` (`53fb850d-a59c-4690-816f-01aea06f0645`).
- Only environment: `production` (`910dff25-75b6-42b2-bf6b-e2601ba9d7d2`).
- Only service: `RT-connect` (`9544c3e6-c8bd-4c29-b62e-c6172eb51af3`).
- Latest deployment: `FAILED`, deployment `b8037f6c-720c-407c-b5e4-34421358b4a3`, stopped.
- No service/custom domain and no Railway bucket were present in the status payload.
- Account and project token scopes were verified without printing token values.
- Railway CLI was not installed globally; `npx @railway/cli` version `5.49.1` was used read-only.
- Workspace usage query returned `UNAUTHORIZED`; exact billing/usage remains unavailable with the supplied token scope and must not be guessed.

Failed deployment root cause from build log: Railpack could not determine a build because the deployed commit contained only documents/static files and no `start.sh`, Dockerfile, Python/Node application manifest or supported runnable source. No redeploy was attempted.

## Repository evidence

- Repository contained only the four canonical Markdown files before P0 artifact creation.
- `.env` is Git-ignored and untracked.
- Secret values were not read into output; only key names were inventoried.
- User-owned deletions are preserved: `UI-UX.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `Biological-toolkit.html`.
- User-owned rename is preserved: `technical.md` → `technical-specification.md`.
- No reset, checkout or restoration of deleted files was performed.

## P0 deliverables

| Deliverable | Location | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Baseline snapshot | `docs/p0-baseline.md` | Verified |
| Traceability matrix | `docs/traceability-matrix.md` | Verified |
| Module registry | `docs/module-registry.md` | Verified |
| Route registry | `docs/route-registry.md` | Verified |
| Environment/secret inventory | `docs/environment-inventory.md` | Verified |
| Railway failed-deployment issue | `docs/issues/railway-failed-deployment.md` | Verified |

## Tests and checks

- P0 live Stitch project/screen/design-system check: PASS.
- Railway account-token project query: PASS.
- Railway project-token scope query: PASS.
- Railway status query: PASS.
- Railway failed deployment log retrieval: PASS.
- Railway workspace usage query: UNAVAILABLE (`UNAUTHORIZED`), recorded without guessing cost.
- Documentation consistency scan: PASS — source hashes equal recorded baseline; legacy hidden Biological IDs have no active mapping; all 17 modules occur in registry and traceability matrix.
- Secret scan: PASS — no `.env` value was found in tracked Markdown; inventory contains variable names only.
- Git diff check: PASS — only CRLF conversion notices were emitted; no whitespace error was reported.
- P0 exit audit: PASS — canonical technical filename, no UI-UX dependency, all four active application screens have owners, all other module screen gaps are explicit, Stitch/Railway IDs are recorded.
- P1 API pytest: PASS — 7 tests; FastAPI health/version/error/correlation contracts verified.
- P1 API quality: PASS — Ruff and strict mypy on 15 source files.
- P1 migration contract: PASS — Alembic revision `20260905_0001` renders PostgreSQL DDL successfully; up/down functions are present.
- P1 OpenAPI: PASS — generated contract at `docs/openapi.json` verifies reproducibly.
- P1 API process smoke: PASS — temporary local Uvicorn process returned `health=ok`, a correlation ID and version metadata; process was stopped and port released.
- P1 web quality: PASS — lint, TypeScript type check, 1 component test and production Vite build.
- P1 web E2E: PASS — 1 Playwright Chromium test against production preview build.
- P1 dependency checks: PASS — Python `pip check`; production Node `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` found no vulnerability.
- P1 source secret scan: PASS — no value from local `.env` appeared outside ignored environment files.
- P1 Compose verification: PASS — Docker Desktop Linux engine built the complete stack; all five services healthy; clean PostgreSQL migration, synthetic seed persistence, API readiness and web health passed. The scoped test stack and volumes were removed by the verifier.
- P2 JWT security contract: PASS — 17 API tests cover missing Bearer, missing configuration, valid asymmetric token, expiry, issuer, audience, role, signature and JWKS-client failure; Ruff and strict mypy pass. This is local cryptographic evidence, not a live Supabase sign-in result.
- P2 deployment preparation: PASS — `apps/api/railway.toml` now applies the baseline migration before deploy; staging Railway/Supabase variable contracts and runbooks are in `deployment/`.
- P2 Railway deployment foundation: PASS — effective settings were applied directly in staging and production; both deployments use `PORT=8000`, `/api/v1/health`, `alembic upgrade head`, and both public `/health` plus `/ready` smoke checks returned HTTP 200.
- P2 Railway permission audit: account token can read production status but `railway link`/environment mutation is rejected with `UNAUTHORIZED`; usage query is also unauthorized. No Railway resource was created or changed.
- The permission-audit snapshot above is historical; the current Railway service settings were successfully changed through the dashboard and are recorded in the superseding live evidence note above.
- P2 Railway source audit: the old failed deployment analyzed `aa5dce6`, but `origin/main` now points to `dc6ee79` and contains the API/web source. The deployment for `dc6ee79` was skipped because the GitHub secret-guard job failed; API and web jobs passed. The CI guard has been corrected to allow `.env.example` templates while rejecting private environment files and credentials.
- P2 post-change local regression: PASS — full `scripts/verify-p1.ps1 -WithContainers` completed after JWT, CORS and Railway manifest changes: 17 API tests, lint/type checks, migration SQL, web checks, five healthy Compose services, in-container migration, synthetic seed persistence, API readiness and web health. The scoped stack and test volumes were removed.
- P2 Stitch recheck: PASS — project `RT-connect` remains public with the Clinical Precision Interface design system, the four active QA application screens, and four hidden/deprecated Biological screen instances. No Stitch design was altered during P2.

## Blockers

- Correction on 2026-09-05: both Railway tokens are present in root `.env` and authenticate successfully through the Railway API. Account-token access resolves project `prolific-learning`; project-token scope resolves its production environment. The earlier missing-token report was incorrect. Standard dotenv parsing supports spaces around `=` and quoted values.
- Supabase URL and publishable key are present as names but have empty values. This is the remaining Auth configuration dependency.
- Actual credentials were found in `.env.example` and replaced with empty placeholders; the user's `.env` was preserved.
- Railway account token lacks the write scope needed to create/link staging and the usage scope needed to view costs. A project-write credential is required before any billable Railway resource can be provisioned.
- The current Railway production service has not deployed `dc6ee79`; it still reports the old failed deployment and the new deployment as skipped. After the CI fix is pushed and green, verify Railway sees `dc6ee79` before any staging/production deployment decision.
- The live Railway service metadata still reports `rootDirectory=null` and `dockerfilePath=null`. Configure `/apps/api` on a staging service/environment before testing the Railway Dockerfile; do not use the current production service as the P2 test target.

## Known limitations

- No staging Railway environment or PostgreSQL service exists yet; these belong to P2.
- No Supabase configuration keys are present in `.env`; Auth project/configuration is required by P2/P3.
- Four Biological designs must be regenerated in P12–P15.
